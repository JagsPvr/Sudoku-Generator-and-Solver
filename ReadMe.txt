	4)Tested made funtions on terminal and then linked them to Gtk with more focus on gtk side.
	5)For simplicity, I made many functions for small small things.	
	6)For 25*25 , I realised that My function doesn't work fine, so just made small adjustments which is more on logical 			side, and less coding.
